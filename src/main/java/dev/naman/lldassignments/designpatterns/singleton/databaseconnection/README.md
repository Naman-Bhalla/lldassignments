Implement a Singleton class called "DatabaseConnection" in Java. 
The class should have the following features:
- A method `void connect()` to simulate connecting to the database
  - It should print `Connected to the database.`
- A method `void executeQuery(String query)` to simulate executing a query on the database
  - It should print `Executing query: {query given in param}`
