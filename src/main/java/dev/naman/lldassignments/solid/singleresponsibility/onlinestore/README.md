You are given a simple Java class called `OnlineStore`. Refactor the
`OnlineStore` class and add any other necessary code to adhere to the 
Single Responsibility Principle. Ensure that the original functionality 
is maintained after refactoring.  
You can look through the test cases in the starting codebase to figure
out the desired solution. Each of the test cases in each `*Test` file should
pass to get full score.
